## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Q: in the R dataset Puromycin, explain the column names: conc, reate, state.

the built-in R dataset **`Puromycin`**, the columns come from a classic enzyme kinetics experiment. Here’s what each one means:

### `conc`

-   **Substrate concentration**

    Measured in **parts per million (ppm)**

    This is the concentration of **puromycin**, the substance affecting the reaction

    Think of this as the *input level* being fed to the enzyme system.

### `rate`

(I’m assuming you meant `rate`, not `reate` — the column name is `rate` in R.)

-   **Reaction rate**

-   Measured as the **rate of change in optical density** (ΔOD per minute)

-   This reflects how fast the enzymatic reaction is happening

This is typically the **response variable** in regressions using this dataset.

### `state`

-   A **factor** indicating the experimental condition

    Two levels:

    -   `"treated"` – the enzyme was treated with puromycin

    -   `"untreated"` – the enzyme was not treated

This lets you compare how treatment changes the reaction rate at the same concentration.

### How they’re usually used together

A common model looks like:

```         
lm(rate ~ conc * state, data = Puromycin) 
```

Which asks:

-   How does reaction rate change with concentration?

-   Does treatment shift the baseline rate (intercept)?

-   Does treatment change the *effect* of concentration (slope)?
