## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Q: in the R dataset Puromycin, explain the column names: conc, reate, state.

the built-in R dataset **`Puromycin`**, the columns come from a classic enzyme kinetics experiment. Here’s what each one means:

### `conc`

-   **Substrate concentration**

    Measured in **parts per million (ppm)**

    This is the concentration of **puromycin**, the substance affecting the reaction

    Think of this as the *input level* being fed to the enzyme system.

### `rate`

(I’m assuming you meant `rate`, not `reate` — the column name is `rate` in R.)

-   **Reaction rate**

-   Measured as the **rate of change in optical density** (ΔOD per minute)

-   This reflects how fast the enzymatic reaction is happening

This is typically the **response variable** in regressions using this dataset.

### `state`

-   A **factor** indicating the experimental condition

    Two levels:

    -   `"treated"` – the enzyme was treated with puromycin

    -   `"untreated"` – the enzyme was not treated

This lets you compare how treatment changes the reaction rate at the same concentration.

### How they’re usually used together

A common model looks like:

```         
lm(rate ~ conc * state, data = Puromycin) 
```

Which asks:

-   How does reaction rate change with concentration?

-   Does treatment shift the baseline rate (intercept)?

-   Does treatment change the *effect* of concentration (slope)?

Liam Chat Gpt Question:

In R, what does the output of summary() function mean when applied to a linear model?

Answer:

When you run `summary()` on a linear model in R (created with `lm()`), R is giving you a **compact statistical report** about how well the model fits and how each predictor behaves. Think of it as the model’s “report card.”

Here’s how to read it, section by section.

## 1. Call

```         
Call: lm(formula = y ~ x1 + x2, data = mydata) 
```

This just reminds you **what model you fit**—the response variable, predictors, and data used.

## 2. Residuals

```         
Residuals:     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
```

Residuals are the **differences between observed and predicted values**.

-   **Min / Max**: extreme errors

-   **1Q / Median / 3Q**: distribution of residuals

What you want:

-   Median close to **0**

-   Rough symmetry around 0\
    (Big skew or extreme values can signal problems like nonlinearity or outliers.)

## 3. Coefficients

```         
Coefficients:             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) x1 x2 
```

This is the heart of the summary.

### Columns explained

-   **Estimate**\
    The estimated regression coefficient\
    → “For a one-unit increase in `x`, `y` changes by this amount (holding others constant).”

-   **Std. Error**\
    Uncertainty of the estimate\
    → Smaller = more precise estimate

-   **t value**

    ```         
    Estimate / Std. Error 
    ```

    Measures how far the estimate is from zero in standard-error units

-   **Pr(\>\|t\|)** (p-value)\
    Tests **H₀: coefficient = 0**

    Common interpretation:

    -   `< 0.05` → statistically significant

    -   `≥ 0.05` → not strong evidence of an effect

The stars (`***`, `**`, `*`) are just visual shortcuts for significance levels.

## 4. Residual Standard Error (RSE)

```         
Residual standard error: 2.31 on 96 degrees of freedom 
```

-   Typical size of prediction errors

-   In the **units of the response variable**

-   Lower is better (but only meaningful relative to the scale of `y`)

## 5. Multiple R-squared and Adjusted R-squared

```         
Multiple R-squared:  0.62 Adjusted R-squared: 0.59 
```

-   **Multiple R²**\
    Proportion of variance in `y` explained by the model

-   **Adjusted R²**\
    Penalizes for extra predictors\
    → Better for comparing models with different numbers of variables

Rule of thumb:

-   Adjusted R² is usually the one you trust more

## 6. F-statistic

```         
F-statistic: 15.4 on 2 and 96 DF, p-value: 1.2e-06 
```

This tests:

> **Do all predictors together explain more variance than a model with no predictors?**

-   Null hypothesis: all coefficients (except intercept) = 0

-   Small p-value → the model is **overall significant**

## Big picture

`summary(lm())` tells you:

-   🔹 How strong the overall model is

-   🔹 Which predictors matter (and which don’t)

-   🔹 How precise the estimates are

-   🔹 How much variation you’re explaining

If you want, I can:

-   Walk through a **real example output line by line**

-   Explain **common traps** (like over-interpreting R²)

-   Help you interpret your **own model output** 👀
